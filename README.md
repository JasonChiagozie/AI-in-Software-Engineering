# AI-in-Software-Engineering

**Week 4 Assignment: Building Intelligent Software Solutions — Code, Analysis, and Results.**

This repository contains my Week 4 submission for the AI for Software Engineering course by Power Learn Project Academy (PLP Academy).  
It demonstrates how AI can automate coding, testing, and predictive modeling in software development.

## 📘 Contents

### 🧩 Part 1 — Theoretical Analysis
- Answers to short questions and case study on **AIOps**.
- Discusses how AI tools enhance development and deployment.

### 💻 Part 2 — Practical Implementation
**Task 1:** *AI Code Completion with GitHub Copilot*  
- Compared AI-suggested vs manually written code for sorting a list of dictionaries.

**Task 2:** *Automated Testing with Selenium*  
- Created and executed a login page test (valid/invalid credentials).

**Task 3:** *Predictive Analytics with Kaggle Dataset*  
- Built a Random Forest model to predict issue priorities (high/medium/low).  
- Evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

### 🧠 Part 3 — Ethical Reflection
- Reflected on potential data bias and fairness in AI-driven predictions.
